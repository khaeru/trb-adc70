## `adc70@trbenergy.org`

The [adc70@trbenergy.org](https://mailman-mail5.webfaction.com/listinfo/adc70) (click for list options) mailing list is for ADC70 Members and Friends.

It is meant to host discussions like the ones in our committee meetingsâ€”perhaps only a few participants do most of the speaking, but "within earshot" of interested colleagues who can chime in if they have something to add.

- E-mails from the list have "[ADC70 Members & Friends] " in the `Subject:` line, for you to use with automatic sorting in your mail program.
- The list is *closed* and *visible only* to Members and Friends of ADC70.
    - We keep it up-to-date with the official TRB lists.
    - Non-Members can self-nominate as Friends of ADC70 [here](https://www.mytrb.org/Committees/SelfNominationAsFriend.aspx).
- [Archives](https://mailman-mail5.webfaction.com/private/adc70/) are available.
