**`trb-adc70`** on Google Groups is for ADC70 Members and Friends.

It is meant to host discussions like the ones in our committee meetingsâ€”perhaps only a few participants do most of the speaking, but "within earshot" of interested colleagues who can chime in if they have something to add.

It offers the following features:

- You can post and view topics on the web at [**https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/trb-adc70**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/trb-adc70) (embedded below).
    - In order to do this, you must have a Google account; but your membership in `trb-adc70` is still associated with your official/work e-mail.
- You can post via e-mail to [**trb-adc70@googlegroups.com**](mailto:trb-adc70@googlegroups.com).
- You [choose how many e-mails to receive](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/1047839):
    - No e-mails ever.
    - One e-mail for every new post.
    - One summary e-mail, at most, each day.
    - One summary e-mail every 25 new posts.
- E-mails from the group have "[TRB Energy] " in the `Subject:` line, for you to use with automatic sorting in your mail program.
- The group is *closed* and *visible only* to Members and Friends of ADC70.
    - We keep it up-to-date with the official TRB lists.
    - Non-Members can self-nominate as Friends of ADC70 [here](https://www.mytrb.org/Committees/SelfNominationAsFriend.aspx).
- Search is enabled for older posts.

Using these, each member can use the group as if it is a web forum (by turning off all e-mails); a simple mailing list (by ignoring the web access option); or however suits them best.
